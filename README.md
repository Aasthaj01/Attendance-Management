# Attendance-Management
An efficient module that uses facial recognition method using OpenCV to manage the attendance records of employees or students. 
Tracking the presence of the user is becoming one of the problems in todayâ€™s world. The attendance records which are handled using logbook takes a lot of time and are difficult to maintain. So an attendance system based on facial recognition can act as a real world solution to this problem and add great heights of simplicity for tracking the attendance.

External libraries:
1. dlib
2. face_recognition (which is an easy to use set of face recognition utilities that wraps around dlib)

Face recognition: 
The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.
